# VillageVacances_for_visitors

Here is the repository containing my whole project which concerns a fake vacation village.
This project had been done myself during my 2nd year of IT bachelor. 
I did it on my own, because my partner couldn't continue at this time for personal reasons.
Nonetheless, he had helped me to design the data base which is used in this project.

You can find a user manual explaining how to navigate through the website.
